# 1-using-Docker
This section creates a docker image for a Go app used by Kubernetes in the [2-using-Kind](https://github.com/Fabr1ce/building-apps-for-k8s/tree/main/2-using-Kind) section of this repo, it also builds and tests the corresponding container.

### The first step here is to build the app locally to test it by doing the following:

1. On the CLI, build the app by running:

	```
	go build -0 sever .
	```
   then to run the built app:

	```
	./server
	```

2. In the browser, go to `localhost:8000`, and the message on line 20 of the main.go file should display: `v0.3 Building Apps For k8s app says Hi`.


### Build Docker Image
 
The second step is to build the Docker image and have it ready for when k8s will use it:

1. Build the image using the CLI, replace *name-of-image* with a chosen name:

	```
	docker build -t <name-for-image> .

	```
2. (Optional): Tag image and push it to dockerhub registry, get *image-id* from outputfrom cmd above and *name-for-image* from same cmd above:

	```
	docker tag <image-id> <name-for-image>:0.1

	```
	```
	docker login   # need to have a dockerhub account
	```
	
	```
	docker push <name-for-image>:0.1
	```
	
 - The new image can be tested by running its container and going to localhost:8000 to check if the log message in main.go is displayed:

	```
	docker run -d --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000/tcp <name-for-image>:0.1

	```
	- Go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to check that the app is running.
 - To stop the container/app:

	```
	docker stop <container-id>

	```

That's it! The go app image is created, tested and pushed to a registry where k8s can fetch it later to build pods.

This [repo](https://github.com/Fabr1ce/building-apps-for-k8s/tree/main/2-using-Kind) is an example of how this image can be used to build a Kubernetes pod.
